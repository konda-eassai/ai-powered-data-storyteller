# AI-Powered Data Storyteller Dashboard

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning application that allows users to upload datasets, perform automated exploratory data analysis, and generate predictive insights through interactive visualizations.

The application is designed to demonstrate practical data science workflows including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and insight communication.


## Problem Statement
Organizations often spend significant time manually analyzing datasets to extract meaningful insights. This project aims to automate exploratory analysis and provide predictive intelligence through a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Upload CSV datasets for instant analysis  
- Automated exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Machine learning-based prediction (Employee Attrition use case)  
- Interactive charts and visual summaries  
- Exportable reports in PDF and Word formats  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Streamlit  

## Project Workflow
1. Data ingestion and validation  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature engineering and model training  
5. Model evaluation and prediction  
6. Visualization and report generation  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/konda-eassai/ai-powered-data-storyteller.git
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application: streamlit run app.py

## Results
- Built a machine learning model achieving ~88% accuracy on benchmark employee attrition datasets  
- Reduced manual analysis effort by automating EDA and report generation  
- Enabled faster insight delivery through dashboards and downloadable summaries
